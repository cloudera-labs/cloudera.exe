# integration_config.yml

# Minimal cloudera.exe configuration to construct a CDP testing environment
# Will recursively merge and overwrite any variables defined within a Target
# (i.e. vars/main.yml)

# You can use this file to create specific conditions for testing that are
# outside of a given target's configuration. Just be mindful that any changes 
# here will proprogate to all targets, so depending on your testing and development,
# you might want to limit execution to specified targets.

# Specify any environment variables for modules and libraries like CDPCLI, AWS, etc.
