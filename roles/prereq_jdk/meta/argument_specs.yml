    short_description: Set up the JDK
    description:
      - Set up the Java Development Kit (JDK), optionally installing the JDK itself.
      - For JDK 9 and below, optionally enable the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy.
      - If the JDK is installed from the Cloudera repo, add any missing symlinks.
      - The primary JDK (as defined by jdk_provider and jdk_version) will always be set as the system default and linked to /usr/bin/java.
      - Any additional JDKs installed via additional_jdk_packages will not be set as the system default; to use them, explicit paths must be referenced in scripts or applications.
